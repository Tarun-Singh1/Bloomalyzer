The Mission: Making Earth's Vital Signs Visible to All
The health of our planet is often described in complex charts and massive datasets, hidden from public view. Our project for the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025 was to solve the "BloomWatch" challenge by taking one of these vital signs—the seasonal "pulse of life" in an ecosystem—and translating it into a story that is simple, beautiful, and understandable for everyone.

Bloomalyzer is our solution. It's a data-driven narrative that proves the direct, cause-and-effect relationship between historic winter rains and the incredible 2023 California Superbloom that followed. We didn't just want to show a pretty picture; we wanted to make the invisible, visible.

✨ Key Features
Interactive Before & After Slider: A powerful tool that lets you slide between a normal, dry year (2022) and the vibrant superbloom year (2023).

🔬 Dual View Mode: Instantly toggle between a natural "True Color" photograph and a scientific "NDVI" map to see both the beauty and the data.

📈 12-Month Timeline Chart: A stunning combination chart that visualizes the complete lifecycle of the bloom and scientifically proves its connection to the preceding winter rainfall.

Story-Driven Interface: A seamless, single-page experience that guides the user on a journey of scientific discovery.

Our Scientific Journey: From Hypothesis to Proof
Our project was a real scientific endeavor. We didn't just pick a topic and build; we explored, tested, and pivoted based on the data.

💬 Our initial research into a bloom in Brazil revealed a scientifically interesting but visually subtle signal. We made a critical, data-driven decision to pivot our focus to the California Superbloom to tell a more dramatic and accessible story, demonstrating our ability to adapt to data-driven findings.

This journey led us to a powerful discovery: a 78% increase in vegetation density (NDVI) in the Carrizo Plain, a massive and undeniable signal of the bloom's impact.
